# Andromeda Bot

The andromeda bot is a discord bot named after the Andromeda Guild on Stormrage-EU. Currently its sole purpose is to annoy raiders who haven't signed up for raids by pinging them in discord repeatedly. The bot requires that the guild uses wowaudit.com to handle raid signups.

## Dependencies
* `pip install discord.py`
* `pip install aiohttp`
* `pip install python-dotenv`
